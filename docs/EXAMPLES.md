## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Pipeline

Extract, prepare, and format character data:

```bash
# Extract metadata
python scripts/extract_metadata.py \
  -i templates/character_template.json \
  -o output/neko_metadata.json

# Prepare datasets
python scripts/prepare_dataset.py \
  -m output/neko_metadata.json \
  -o output/datasets/

# Format for Alpaca
python scripts/format_distillation.py \
  -i output/datasets/instruction_pairs.json \
  -o output/alpaca_data.json \
  -f alpaca
```

### Example 2: Multiple Format Outputs

Generate data in all supported formats:

```bash
# Alpaca format
python scripts/format_distillation.py \
  -i output/datasets/instruction_pairs.json \
  -o output/neko_alpaca.json \
  -f alpaca

# ShareGPT format
python scripts/format_distillation.py \
  -i output/datasets/conversations.json \
  -o output/neko_sharegpt.json \
  -f sharegpt

# JSONL format
python scripts/format_distillation.py \
  -i output/datasets/instruction_pairs.json \
  -o output/neko_data.jsonl \
  -f jsonl
```

### Example 3: Custom Configuration

Create and use a custom configuration:

```bash
# Initialize default config
python scripts/config_manager.py --init config.json

# View configuration
python scripts/config_manager.py -l config.json -p

# Edit config.json manually, then use it with your scripts
# (Scripts will read from config.json if present)
```

## Tips for Creating Character Data

1. **Be Specific**: Include detailed personality traits and speaking quirks
2. **Provide Examples**: The more dialogue samples, the better the training data
3. **Show Consistency**: Make sure dialogue samples reflect the character's personality
4. **Include Context**: Context helps generate more appropriate responses
5. **Tag Emotions**: Emotion tags help create emotionally consistent outputs
6. **Document Relationships**: Relationships add depth to character interactions
